    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a step-by-step and visually-aided walk through the [Cap3D dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiange/Cap3D) filtering logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The filtering process makes use of the 3D asset descriptions provided by [Cap3D](https://cap3d-um.github.io/). These descriptions detail assets from a large-scale and broad-categoried collection of open-source 3D models (namely [Objaverse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08051), [Objaverse-XL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05663), and [ABO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06199)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to filter these assets for domain alignment with an architectural/building/interior design use case, with basic natural language processing techniques."
